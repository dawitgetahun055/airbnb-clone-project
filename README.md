### ❗ Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Identifying and documenting the design properties of a mockup ensures:
- **Consistency:** Keeps the user interface cohesive across all pages and components.
- **Efficiency:** Makes it easier for developers to implement the design without guessing.
- **Collaboration:** Helps both designers and developers stay aligned with shared design guidelines.
- **Scalability:** Supports future updates and additions without breaking the visual identity.

Clear design properties are like a blueprint — they help bring the mockup to life exactly as envisioned.
